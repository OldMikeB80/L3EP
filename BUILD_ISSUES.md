# NDT Exam Prep - Build Issues & Resolution Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ React Native project properly initialized with TypeScript
- ✅ All source code migrated successfully
- ✅ Java 21 configured (via Android Studio's bundled JDK)
- ✅ Android SDK and ADB working correctly
- ✅ Dependencies installed (except react-native-svg-charts removed due to compatibility)
- ❌ Build failing due to dependency issues

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Java Version (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: Build required Java 17+, system had Java 11
- **Solution**: Configured gradle.properties to use Android Studio's JDK 21
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. React Native SVG Charts Dependency

- **Issue**: react-native-svg-charts pulls in react-native-svg@7.2.1 which is incompatible with React Native 0.80.1
- **Solution**: Removed react-native-svg-charts, installed react-native-svg@latest
- **Status**: ⚠️ Need to implement charts differently or find alternative library

### 3. Build Process

- **Issue**: Build process took extremely long (46+ minutes) then failed silently
- **Possible causes**:
  - First-time NDK download
  - Dependency conflicts
  - Memory/resource constraints

## Tomorrow's Action Plan

1. **Clean Start**

   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

2. **Fix Dependencies**

   - Find alternative to react-native-svg-charts (e.g., victory-native, react-native-chart-kit)
   - Or implement custom charts using react-native-svg directly

3. **Verify Environment**

   ```bash
   npx react-native doctor
   ```

4. **Build with Better Logging**

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android --verbose > build.log 2>&1
   ```

5. **Alternative Build Method**
   - Try building from Android Studio directly
   - This can provide better error messages

## Required Changes to Code

### ProgressScreen.tsx

- Remove react-native-svg-charts imports
- Replace chart components with alternative solution

## Environment Details

- macOS: Darwin 24.5.0
- Device: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (SM-S938U)
- Android Version: 15
- React Native: 0.80.1
- Node: 18+
- Java: 21 (Android Studio bundled)
